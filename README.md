These reports may include details about the device type, operating system version, and the circumstances of the crash. The information collected does not include personal data that could directly identify you.
  
- **Anonymous Identifiers:** We collect anonymous identifiers such as unique device identifiers (UDIDs) or other non-personally identifiable information to understand how the App is used and to improve the Appâ€™s functionality.

**1.2 Location Data**

- **Location Data:** The App collects your location data for the purpose of creating posts that are relevant to your current location. This data allows you to engage with the features of the App that require location information, such as tagging posts or discovering nearby events or items. The location data collected is only used while the App is in use and is not stored for any other purposes.

We use the information collected to:

- Improve the functionality, performance, and reliability of the App.
- Provide you with location-based features and services.

### 3. Sharing of Information

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. We may share anonymous data, such as crash reports and usage statistics, with third-party service providers who assist us in improving the App. These third parties are required to keep this information confidential and are only permitted to use it for the purposes we specify.

### 4. Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
